## About this project

This project is the final Sprint I built for the Backend Java Development Bootcamp (IT Academy).
It's an API REST of a Dice Game with simple rules. Use the dedicated endpoint to join the game an register. Then use the endpoint to roll the dice: if the sum of the two dices is lucky 7, you WIN. Otherwise, you lose. All your plays will be registered in the DB and the winning ratio calculated.

API REST best practices applied.
